## Overview

## Account & Authentication

- You must sign in with a **Google account** to publish content, like shaders, or interact with the community.
- You are responsible for the security of your Google account.
- Anonymous users may browse and download community content but cannot publish or interact.

## Community Workshop

### What You Can Do
- ✅ Create and publish custom shader effects
- ✅ Browse, download, and use shaders created by others
- ✅ Like shaders you enjoy
- ✅ Update or delete your own published shaders

### What You Cannot Do
- ❌ Use **offensive, vulgar, or inappropriate** names or descriptions for your shaders
- ❌ Publish shaders with **malicious intent** (e.g., designed to crash devices or exploit users)
- ❌ **Spam** the community with duplicate or low-effort content

## Content Ownership

- You **retain ownership** of the shader code you create and publish.
- By publishing to the FlowClip Workshop, you grant other users a **non-exclusive license to download and use** your shader within the FlowClip app.
- If you enable "Protect Source Code," the app UI will hide your shader code from other users. However, this is a **client-side protection** and does not constitute encryption or DRM.
- You may **delete your shaders** at any time, which removes them from the community.

## Reporting & Moderation

- You can **report shaders or users** that violate these terms using the in-app report feature.
- We review reports and take action as necessary, including:
  - Removing offensive or policy-violating shaders
  - Restricting or banning users who repeatedly violate these terms
- Abuse of the reporting system (e.g., false reports) may result in action against your account.
